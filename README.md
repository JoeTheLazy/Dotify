# Dotify

## Homework 2: Activities & RecyclerView
### Nikolai Frank Nilsen

The Dotify app is a simple mockup of a music player for android phones. It features functionality for viewing a list of songs and their details, as well as shuffling the song list and selecting individual songs to mock listening to. From here, the app can keep track of the # of times a song is played, and for mocking when the user wants to move between songs in an album.

No music playing or song organizing functionality exists. This app is only a simple mockup.
