# Dotify

## Homework 1: Layouts & Events
### Nikolai Frank Nilsen

The Dotify app is a simple mockup of a music player for android phones. It features functionality for changing a user name, keeping track of the # of times a song is played, and for mocking when the user wants to move between songs in an album.

No music playing or song organizing functionality exists. This app is only a simple mockup of a potential screen for Dotify.
