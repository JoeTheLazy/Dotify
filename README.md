# Dotify

## Homework 3: Fragments, Activity Lifecycle & Rotation
### Nikolai Frank Nilsen

The Dotify app is a simple mockup of a music player for android phones. It features functionality for changing a user name, keeping track of the # of times a song is played, and for mocking when the user wants to move between songs in an album.

This version also keeps track of # of plays, and song previously previewed, as well as limited landscape view support.

No music playing or song organizing functionality exists. This app is only a simple mockup of a potential screen for Dotify.
